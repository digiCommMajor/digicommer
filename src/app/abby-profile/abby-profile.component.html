      Hello! So you want to know more about how I got into Digi Comm? Well, when I first came to college, I really had
      no idea what I wanted to study. I am the kind of person who just wants
      to learn a little bit of everything. I'm also a pretty fast learner and get kind of tired doing the same thing for
      a long time. When I found out about Digital Communication it was a perfect match! I could
      do a little
      bit of graphic design, computer science, and video production. I enjoy the design aspect the most because there
      are endless possiblities to how you can use your skills like how I got to work making a board game!
